# Info

An example Symfony project using the API Platform to expose some resources by implementing the DTO pattern to manually define the input/output structure of resource.

# Usage

Bring the containers up with ```docker-compose up [-d]```

Run the migration(s) then load the fixtures.

**N.B** This makes use of an external network - remove it from the docker-compose file if not required.
